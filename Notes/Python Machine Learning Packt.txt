Types of Machine Learning



Supervised Learning:
    Labeled data
    Direct Feedback
    Predict outcome/future

Unsupervised Learning:
    No labels 
    No Feedback
    Find hidden structure in data

Reinforcement Learning 
    Devision Process
    Reward System
    Learn series of actions

Linear Regression

    Given a predictor variable x and a response variable y
    we fit a straight line to this data that minimizes 
    the distance-most commonly the average squared distance-between
    the sample points and the fitted line. 

    The line can be used to predict the outcome of new data.

Finding subgroups with clustering:

    Clustering - allows organization of a pile of information
    into meaningful subgroups (clusters) without having any prior
    knowledge of their group memberships. Clustering is sometimes called
    Unsupervised classification.
