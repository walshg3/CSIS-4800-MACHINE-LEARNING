CSIS-4800-MACHINE-LEARNING is an independent study I had the opportunity to take part it my final semester during undergrad. The study was to learn the field of Machine Learning at my own pace throughout the Semester. I used a variety of resources and textbooks to gain more knowledge on the topic. I will link all sources I used and give proper credit where credit as work is uploaded. So far a list of resources used are:
    Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science (Udemy)
    Google Developers Machine Learning Recipes with Josh Gordon (Youtube - https://goo.gl/KewA03)
    Python Machine Learning - Second Edition (Packt -https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/python-machine-learning-second-edition)
    Machine Learning Subreddits
