# CSIS-4800-MACHINE-LEARNING 

This Repo is for an independent study I had the opportunity to take part in during my final semester of undergrad. The study was to learn the field of Machine Learning at my own pace throughout the Semester. I used a variety of online courses and textbooks to gain more knowledge on the topic. I will link all sources I used and give proper credit as work is uploaded. So far a list of resources used are:

- [Machine Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/)
- [Google Developers Machine Learning Recipes with Josh Gordon](https://goo.gl/KewA03) 
- [Python Machine Learning - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/python-machine-learning-second-edition)
- Machine Learning Subreddits
    
## Dependencies 

For this course I am using [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Anaconda will install most of the dependencies needed for Machine Learning and any additional Libraries I use will be mentioned in each of the files when needed.
