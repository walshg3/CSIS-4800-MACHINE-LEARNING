# CSIS-4800-MACHINE-LEARNING 

This Repo is for an independent study I had the opportunity to take part it my final semester during undergrad. The study was to learn the field of Machine Learning at my own pace throughout the Semester. I used a variety of resources and textbooks to gain more knowledge on the topic. I will link all sources I used and give proper credit where credit as work is uploaded. So far a list of resources used are:

    [Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science] (https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/)
    [Google Developers Machine Learning Recipes with Josh Gordon] (https://goo.gl/KewA03) 
    [Python Machine Learning - Second Edition] (https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/python-machine-learning-second-edition)
    Machine Learning Subreddits
    
## Dependencies 

For this course I am using [Python] (https://www.python.org/) and [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
